# CSC 591 - Graph Data Mining - Fall 2016
## Homeworks

This repository contains the Homeworks that were a part of the aforementioned course, taken by Dr. Nagiza Samatova.
The course introduced me to the following topics:
* Graphs, Graph ADTs
* Spectral Graph Theory
* Community Detection
* Link Analysis
* Kernels, Kernelization
* Anomaly Detection
* Virus Propagation
* Probabilistic Graphical Models

The homeworks cover some of these topics: 
1. [Basics of Graph Theory](/H1GraphTheoryandGraphADTs/avshirod_HW1GraphTheoryandGraphADTs.pdf)
2. Graph Abstract Data Types - [Binary heaps](/H2GraphADTsBinaryHeaps/h2_avshirod.pdf)
3. [Spectral Graph Theory](/H3SpectralGraphTheory/h3_avshirod.html) (using networkx)
4. [Community Detection](/H4CommunityDetectionusingSpectralGraphTheoryAssignment/h4_avshirod.html) using Spectral Graph Theory
5. Probabilistic Graphical Methods [(PGMs)](/H5ProbabilisticGraphicalModelsPGM/hw5_avshirod.pdf)
6. [Community Detection Lecture](/H6ChristosFaloutsosLectureAssignment/h6_FaloutsosLecture_avshirod.pdf) by Dr. Christos Faloutsos
