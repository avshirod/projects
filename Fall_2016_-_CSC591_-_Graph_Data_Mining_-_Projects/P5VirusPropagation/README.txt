----------------------------------------------------------

The ipython notebook contains the code.

A HTML file with output is also in the folder.

To run the IPython file succesfully, take care of the imports in the first cell.
And provide path to the data file.


PS:
The outputs over the data seem wierd.
I am not sure if they are happening because graph is sparse or there is some wierd calculation gaff-up that is happening in the background.
The code is logically correct, and runs perfectly when tried in small chunks.
(Specifically, the eigenvalues are wierd.)
