# CSC 591 - Graph Data Mining - Fall 2016
## Projects

This repository contains the Projects that were a part of the aforementioned course, taught by Dr. Nagiza Samatova.
The course introduced me to the following topics:
* Graphs, Graph ADTs
* Spectral Graph Theory
* Community Detection
* Link Analysis
* Kernels, Kernelization
* Anomaly Detection
* Virus Propagation
* Probabilistic Graphical Models

| Project | Description |
| :------ | :---------- |
| Network Properties in Spark Graph Frames | A tutorial project that introduces to Spark Graph Frames, valuable network metrics, how to calculate them, and effect on network by varying them. |
| Performance metrics for Community Detection | An introductory project to performance metrics; explored using a community detection example in Python. |
| Kernelization | Explores Kernel tricks for graphs using Python. A pseudo data set is generated, on which normal ML methods fail; then optimum results are obtained by identifying and applying Kernel functions. |
| Anomaly Detection in Time Evolving Networks | Implemented NetSimile algorithm to detect anomalies on a collection of time-evolving graphs using Python. Calculated eigen-behavior over a sliding window to calculate moving average based on set of extracted features, such as degree of node, clustering coefficient, edges in ego-net. |
| Virus Propagation | Developed a Python application to find the optimum immunization policy using simulation. |
