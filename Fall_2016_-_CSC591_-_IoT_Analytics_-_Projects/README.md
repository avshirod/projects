# CSC 591 - IoT Analytics - Fall 2016
## Projects

This class was taught by Dr. Harry Perros.  
It acted as an introduction to Internet of Things (IoT) through a data analyst's perspective. I learnt various things related to IoT, Networks, Communication in IoT, and experienced first hand the massive amount of data generated in IoT.  

The projects in class covered basic Data Science and Analytics techniques by using an IoT related example, such as -
* Simulation techniques, Queueing theory
* ANOVA
* Linear, multivariate, logistic regression
* Time series forecasting (MA, ES, AR, VAR)
* PCA
* Clustering (Hierarchical, k-means, DBSCAN)
* HMMs
* Neural nets
* SVMs

All projects were done in Python. The project descriptions are as follows:
| Topic | Description |
| :---- | :---------- |
| Simulation (Queueing Theory) | The project is divided in three subtasks - Simulate by hand, simulate by code, find out optimum buffer size and retransmission time. |
| Multiple Regression | Analyzed a multivariate dataset to establish a relation between dependent and independent variables, using linear and multiple regression; and observing the statistical significance of the results. |
| Forecasting | Comparing various time-series models (Simple Moving Average, Exponential Smoothing, Autoregression) against the same data, and reasoning why one gives better results than others. |
| Clustering | Comparing various clustering algorithms (Hierarchical, k-means, DBSCAN) against the same data, and reasoning why one gives better results. |
| Hidden Markov Models | Translating the HMM equations into code and forecasting data in future. |
