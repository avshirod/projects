## CSC 505 - Design and Analysis of Algorithms
### Homeworks

This repository contains the Homework files for the Algorithms course I took at NC State University in Spring 2016.  
The course was taught by Dr. Matthias Stallmann.

The course introduced me to the following topics:
* Asymptotic notations
* *Divide-and-Conquer* and *Recurrence* algorithm design paradigms
* Sorting algorithms
* Dynamic Programming
* Disjoint Sets
* Graph Searching (BFS, DFS)
* Minimum Spanning Trees
* P versus NP problem

The files in the repository are the 5 homeworks that were part of the coursework and cover the topics mentioned above.  

I relish them, because of the beautiful typesetting done in LaTeX,  
and because they teach & remind of the Fundamentals of Computer Science.
