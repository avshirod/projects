## Abstract
[Agar.io](http://agar.io/) is web-browser based multiplayer, real-time strategy game. The player (bot) and its opponents are circular cells who wander throughout the environment. You start as a solitary cell. The objective of the game is to grow larger in size, achieved by consuming smaller opponents and food (aka pellets), while staying away from bigger opponents to avoid being eaten. The environment also consists of viruses, which are stationary. This project aims at developing a bot to play this game as efficiently as possible.  
The bot can recognize positions of other cells in the visible environment by continuous image processing. After perceiving the environment, it will apply various techniques discussed later in this report to achieve the game objectives as intelligently as possible. Various Game AI algorithms, combined with decision making, decide the next movement as input for the mouse pointer, and a decision to shoot or split. Our main goal is to use a combination of AI algorithms with tweaked and tested parameters to make the bot a good player of the game and achieve a set of defined goals.

## Methodology
Refer to [Final Update (Report)](reports/project_report.pdf) for a detailed overview of how the bot works.  

## Results
The [presentation](reports/bot_for_agario.pptx) that we gave in class mentions results in a concise manner.
