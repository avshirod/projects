# CSC 591 - Advanced Algorithms for Business Intelligence - Spring 2016
## Projects

This repository is a collection of Course Projects for the aforementioned course taught by Dr. Nagiza Samatova.  
This course was offered for the first time when I took it, and is one of the best courses I have ever taken.  
The coursework contained over 40+ assignments, projects, homeworks, that covered a vast number of topics in the genre of Business Intelligence.  

This course introduced me to the basics of Data Science, methods, and how-why it is used in industry. Following are some of the topics that the coursework projects and assignments covered:  
* Graphs, Graph ADTs
* Spectral Graph Theory
* Community Detection
* Link Analysis
* Kernels, Kernelization
* Anomaly Detection
* Virus Propagation
* Probabilistic Graphical Models

Following is a short description of the projects in the repository. For a detailed explanation, code, and dataset, see the corresponding folder.

| Topic | Technology | Description |
| :---- | :--------: | :---------- |
| [Music Recommender System](/01_ApacheSpark_RecommenderSystems) | Apache Spark, Python | Created a music recommender system in Python, based on public song data from AudioScrobbler, using Collaborative Filtering techniques in Apache Spark. |
| [Real Time Twitter Sentiment Analysis](/02_ApacheSpark_SentimentAnalysis) | Apache Spark, Python | Processed live Twitter data stream using Apache Spark streaming service, with Kafka as a broker to handle data. Analyzed using Python and a word sentiment lexicon. |
| [Predicting Bitcoin Price Variations](/03_BayesianRegression_BitcoinPrediction) | Python | Developed a Python based predictor for variations in the price of the virtual cryptographic currency, using machine learning technique of Bayesian Regression. |
| [Sentiment Analysis of IMDb Movie Reviews](/04_LogisticRegression_SentimentAnalysis) | Python | Built a Python classifier for IMDb movie reviews using Logistic Regression (with NLP feature vectors) and Na√Øve Bayes (with Doc2Vec) methods.
| [Discovering Causality between Manufacturer-Retailer Price Channels](/05_CausalRelation_ManufacturerRetailerPrice) | R | Performed causality analysis of a Soft Drink system at a supermarket. Analysis done using R shows that it follows a vertical-integrated system rather than a Stackelberg leader model. |
| [Market Segmentation of Social Network Data](/06_GraphCommunity_MarketSegmentation) | Python, R | Developed a Python application to identify communities in a college network using attributed graphs and igraph package. The communities are then self-verified by observing influence propagation over the network. |
| [Optimal Adwords Placement](/07_BipartiteGraphMatching_AdWordsPlacement) | Python, R | Replicated the solution for Adwords placement problem in Python, using Online Bipartite Graph Matching, to maximize revenue of the advertisers, and minimize number of unclaimed ad slots. |
| [Anomaly Detection in Time Evolving Networks](/08_TimeEvolvingGraphs_AnomalyDetection) | Python | Developed a Python application to detect anomalies in time evolving network graphs (e.g. p2p network), using the typical eigen-behavior of a feature set. |
